            The YouTube Music app was unveiled in October 2015 and released the following month; its release came alongside the
            unveiling of YouTube Red, a larger subscription service that covers the entirety of the YouTube platform, including the
            Music app. Although redundant to Google's existing Google Play Music All Access subscription service, the app is
            designed for users who primarily consume music through YouTube.[4][5]
            
            On May 17, 2018, YouTube announced a new version of the YouTube Music service, including a web-based desktop player and
            redesigned mobile app, more dynamic recommendations based on various factors, and use of Google artificial intelligence
            technology to search songs based on lyrics and descriptions. In addition, YouTube Music became a separate subscription
            service (positioned as a more direct competitor to Apple Music and Spotify), offering ad-free and background/audio-only
            streaming, and downloading for offline playback, for music content on YouTube. The service's benefits will continue to
            be available as part of the existing YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) service, and to Google Play Music All Access
            subscribers. The YouTube Music subscription is priced in line with its competitors at US$9.99 per-month; the price of
            YouTube Premium was concurrently increased to $11.99 for new subscribers.[6][7]
            
            In 2018, YouTube Music reached multiple sponsorship agreements with Dick Clark Productions to serve as a partner for its
            television specials Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and the American Music Awards.[8][9]

            <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
            <p>
                Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language with signs and symbols. For languages that utilize a
                writing system, inscriptions can complement spoken language by creating a durable version of speech that can be stored
                for future reference or transmitted across distance. Writing, in other words, is not a language, but a tool used to make
                languages readable.[1] Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as
                vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of the
                activity of writing is called a text, and the interpreter or activator of this text is called a reader.[2]
                
                H.G. Wells argued that writing has the ability to "put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of
                states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of
                the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death".[3] As human
                societies emerged, collective motivations for the development of writing were driven by pragmatic exigencies like
                keeping history, maintaining culture, codifying knowledge through curricula and lists of texts deemed to contain
                foundational knowledge (e.g., The Canon of Medicine) or artistically exceptional (e.g., a literary canon), organizing
                and governing societies through the formation of legal systems, census records, contracts, deeds of ownership, taxation,
                trade agreements, treaties, and so on. For example, around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of tra

            <p>
                Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.[1] It is
                performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, preventing aging, developing muscles and the
                cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improving health[2] and also for enjoyment.
                Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and enhance well-being.[3]
